# FishTideLog: digital diary for anglers

## Context
Many fishing enthusiasts still manually record catches and weather conditions. With FishTideLog, we aimed to digitize the process.

## Problem
- No complete and customizable digital logbook 
- Difficulty integrating real-time weather/tide data 
- Interfaces too complex for non-technical users 

## Approach
- Requirements analysis with focus groups of anglers 
- Selection of the **TALL stack (Laravel, Alpine, Livewire, Tailwind)** 
- Continuous testing on mobile-first prototypes 

## Solution
- Responsive app with catch logging, tides, notes 
- Centralized database with species and statistics 
- Simplified interface with graphs 

## Results
- 70% reduction in manual errors 
- Increased community engagement 
- Future roadmap: opening APIs for IoT devices 

## Conclusion
FishTideLog has transformed a niche need into a scalable SaaS platform for sport fishing.
