**Download the template** from the official site or repository.

### Configuring the Blade Templating Engine

Laravel uses Blade as its default templating engine. Blade offers a simple and powerful syntax for creating reusable layouts. Once the template files are added to the correct directory, you need to configure Blade to use them.

Example of configuring a layout:

```php
// To use this layout on a specific page:
@extends('layouts.app')
@section('title', 'Home Page')
@section('content'' template. After downloading and extracting the files, place the static resources in the public/css and public/js directories.
