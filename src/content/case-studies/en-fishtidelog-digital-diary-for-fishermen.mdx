# FishTideLog: digital diary for fishermen

## Context
Many fishing enthusiasts still manually record catches and weather conditions. With FishTideLog, we aimed to digitize the process.

## Problem
- No complete and customizable digital logbook  
- Difficulty integrating real-time weather/tide data  
- Interfaces too complex for non-technical users

## Approach
- Requirements analysis with focus groups of fishermen  
- Selection of the **TALL stack (Laravel, Alpine, Livewire, Tailwind)**  
- Continuous testing on mobile-first prototypes

## Solution
- Responsive app with capture logs, tides, notes  
- Centralized DB with species and statistics  
- Simplified interface with charts

## Results
- 70% reduction in manual errors  
- Increased community engagement  
- Future roadmap: opening APIs for IoT devices

## Conclusion
FishTideLog has transformed a niche requirement into a scalable SaaS platform for sport fishing.
