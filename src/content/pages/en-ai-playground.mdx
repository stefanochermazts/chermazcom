Have you ever seen your dirty and chaotic code transform before your eyes into a clean, readable, and elegant version?
This demo makes it possible: just paste a function full of meaningless variables or confusing logic, and the AI takes care of refactoring it in real time.

The beauty lies in the visual experience: the old code seems to disassemble line by line, only to reassemble into a new version, as if you were witnessing a Matrix-style effect.
A mix of magic and technical control, designed to demonstrate how AI is not just a functional support but also a tool capable of astonishing. Click on "Analyze" to see explanations and suggestions. When you're satisfied, try "Optimize".
