## What I Offer

Practical and accessible solutions for SMEs and teams: analysis, design, and delivery.

# IT Consulting Services

My consulting activity stems from direct experience with companies in various sectors — particularly **banking, manufacturing, and telecom** — where I have had the opportunity to guide teams and IT departments in adopting new technologies and regulatory compliance. I do not offer "packaged" solutions, but concrete pathways that combine analysis, rapid prototyping, continuous testing, and operational support until production deployment. The goal is always the same: **to deliver measurable value quickly**, reducing risks and complexity.

## Microsoft 365 & SharePoint Online

Digital transformation often goes through the digital workplace. I help companies **design and implement corporate intranets** that are not just simple bulletin boards, but everyday work tools.

* We structure knowledge with **taxonomy, metadata, and advanced search**.
* We automate recurring processes with **Power Automate** and integrations to SAP/ERP.
* We create scalable and secure environments, adhering to best practices in **governance and compliance**.

The result is an intranet that reduces IT tickets, speeds up document searches, and improves collaboration between departments.

## AI & Automation

AI is not just experimentation: it is a tool that can alleviate repetitive tasks and give teams more time for high-value activities.

* Development of **RAG-based chatbots** for customer or HR support.
* Integration of intelligent workflows in **Teams, SharePoint, or websites**.
* Connection with external channels (WhatsApp, Messenger) for omnichannel communications.
* Creation of **policies and KPI dashboards** to ensure that AI is measurable and under control.

With an "AI with governance" approach, we avoid the trend effect and aim for stable, secure, and auditable solutions.

## Privacy, Security & Compliance

Regulatory compliance is not a bureaucratic obligation, but a pillar for business resilience and reputation. I have supported regulated clients on their journey towards **DORA, NIS2, and GDPR**, preparing the necessary documentation and assisting teams during audits.

* Initial assessment with gap analysis against regulations.
* Definition of policies and operational procedures.
* Periodic testing of **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery**.
* Creation of compliance matrices and audit-ready packages.

The value is twofold: on one hand, we reduce the risk of penalties, and on the other, we build trust with clients and stakeholders.

## Fractional CTO

Not all companies can or want to hire a full-time CTO, but many need technological guidance. This is where the **Fractional CTO** service comes into play.

* I assist management in defining the **IT and AI roadmap**.
* Support in **vendor selection** and technology governance.
* Definition of **KPI and OKR** to measure the results of IT projects.

The advantage is having technical leadership skills available “on demand,” without the need to create complex internal structures.
