## Introduction to Power Automate Approvals

**Power Automate**, previously known as Microsoft Flow, is an automation platform developed by Microsoft that allows you to automate workflows between different applications and services. This tool enables you to synchronize files, collect data, and automate complex business processes without the need to write code.



Approvals play a crucial role in optimizing business processes. Automating these processes with Power Automate significantly reduces approval times and minimizes manual errors. Automated approvals ensure that requests are handled quickly and accurately, improving the overall productivity of the organization.



The **Power Automate Approvals** have revolutionized the way we manage approvals today. Seamlessly integrating with tools like Outlook and Teams, Power Automate allows users to send and receive approval requests via email or mobile notifications. This not only streamlines the decision-making process but also provides complete traceability of requests and feedback received, enhancing transparency and reliability in the business decision-making process.



## Benefits of Power Automate Approvals in Decision-Making Process Automation

Power Automate offers many advantages for automating business approvals, which help improve efficiency and reduce errors. Here are some of the main benefits:



### Reduction of Approval Times and Increase in Productivity



**Speed**: By automating workflows with Power Automate, it is possible to significantly accelerate the approval process. Requests are sent immediately to approvers via email notifications or mobile devices.  
**Productivity**: This system eliminates long waits and allows employees to focus on other productive activities. It is no longer necessary to manually track the progress of requests, thus improving time management within the company.

### Elimination of Manual Errors Through Automation of Approvals



**Precision**: Automated workflows drastically reduce human errors that can occur during the manual approval process. The rules defined in the system ensure that each request is processed correctly.  
**Reliability**: With Power Automate, approvals follow a predetermined and documented path, ensuring that all requests are handled consistently and in compliance with corporate policies.

These advantages provide greater transparency and traceability in business decisions, enhancing overall operational efficiency.



## How to Easily Create and Manage Approvals with Power Automate

### Step 1: Access and Navigation in the Power Automate Interface

Accessing **Power Automate** is simple. Just go to the official Microsoft Power Automate website and log in with your corporate credentials. Once logged in, you will be presented with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.





**Dashboard**: Here you can quickly view active workflows, recent activities, and other important metrics.  
**Navigazione**: Use the side menu to access various sections such as “My Flows”, “Team Flows”, and “Create”.

### Step 2: Creating the Workflow for Approvals

Creating a new workflow is the first step towards automating approvals.





**Click on 'Create'**: Find the “Create” button at the top of the dashboard.  
**Template Selection**: Choose from the predefined templates or create a custom flow.  
**Setting the Trigger**: For example, you can select the trigger “When an item is created” to start the flow when a new item is added in SharePoint.

### Step 3: Configuration of Approval Actions and Advanced Settings

Once the trigger is set up, it is necessary to configure the approval actions.





**Approval Action**: Add the action “Send an approval request”.
*Request Details*: Specify the name of the approver, the type of approval (e.g., single or multiple approval), and the details of the request.
*Message*: Customize the message that will be sent to the approver via email or mobile notification.
**Conditions**: Add advanced conditions if necessary. For example, send the request only if the amount exceeds a certain threshold.

### Step 4: Testing, Publishing, and Monitoring the Workflow

Before putting the workflow into production, it is important to test it.





**Flow Testing**: Use real or simulated data to verify that everything functions correctly.  
**Publishing**: Once successfully tested, publish the flow to make it operational.  
**Monitoring**:



*Dashboard*: Monitor the status of approval requests directly from the dashboard.  
*Notifiche Email/Mobile*: Ensure that approvers receive timely notifications via Outlook or Teams.

Power Automate offers a comprehensive solution for approval management, integrating tools like Outlook and Teams to streamline the decision-making process.



## Practical Examples of Approval Automation with Power Automate

### Approval of Employee Reports via Email with Power Automate

Automating the approval of employee reports can greatly simplify the process. Using **Power Automate**, you can create a workflow that automatically sends an approval request via email every time an employee uploads a report to SharePoint.





**Trigger**: When a new report is uploaded to a SharePoint library.  
**Action**: Send an approval request via email to the team leader.  
**Condition**: If the report is approved, send a notification to the employee and archive the document in a specific folder; if rejected, send feedback for necessary corrections.

This flow reduces waiting times and minimizes manual errors, keeping all stakeholders informed.



### Budget Request Management through Teams and Power Automate

**Power Automate** can integrate with Microsoft Teams to efficiently manage budget requests. A typical flow for managing budget requests might include:





**Trigger**: A new budget request is submitted via a form in Microsoft Teams.  
**Action**: Send the request to the financial manager via Teams and create a task in Planner.  
**Condition**: If the request is approved, update the status in the form and send an approval notification to the requester; if denied, provide detailed explanations via Teams.

This approach ensures that all requests are traceable and managed promptly, improving the transparency and efficiency of the decision-making process.



### Approvals via Predefined Templates

Additionally, if you want to further simplify the business approval process, you can use predefined workflow templates for approval offered by JotForm. These templates allow you to easily automate approvals in various business scenarios such as vacations, purchases, or expense requests. By combining these templates with Power Automate, you can create a highly efficient environment and completely eliminate the need for manual processes for business approvals.
