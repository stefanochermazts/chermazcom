# SharePoint Framework in 2025: new possibilities for development

When Microsoft introduced the **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)**, the goal was clear: to provide developers with a modern model, based on web technologies, to extend SharePoint Online without relying on server-side solutions.  
Today, in 2025, SPFx has become the **de facto standard** for building web parts, extensions, and integrated applications not only in SharePoint but also in **Microsoft Teams** and the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

In this article, we will explore the **key updates**, the **best development practices**, and the value that SPFx brings to companies looking for a **modern, accessible, and integrated intranet**.

Since its launch, SPFx has seen numerous updates that have expanded its capabilities:

- **React 18 and 19**: now fully supported, with improvements in performance and rendering.  
- **Fluent UI v9**: new design system consistent across the entire Microsoft 365 suite.  
- **Teams personal apps**: SPFx web parts can be packaged as Teams apps, with a single multi-channel development.  
- **Improved support for Graph API**: more efficient queries, caching, and reduced throttling limits.  
- **Simplified deployment**: thanks to GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps, production release is faster.

## Why SPFx Remains Central

Many wonder: with Copilot and the new integrated AIs, does it still make sense to develop in SPFx?  
The answer is yes, because SPFx is not just a framework: it is the **bridge between business data and customized user interfaces**.

With SPFx you can:
- Create custom dashboards for specific departments.  
- Integrate data from ERP/CRM directly into SharePoint.  
- Build widgets for Teams that leverage the same libraries.  
- Apply branding and business logic without sacrificing updates and cloud compatibility.

## Development Updates in 2025

### 1. Support for React Server Components
With the new versions of React, SPFx enables lighter components, faster loading, and a smoother UX.

### 2. Native Integration with AI
Microsoft has introduced SDKs that allow developers to **integrate Copilot and AI models directly into web parts**.  
Example: a web part that analyzes documents uploaded to a library and automatically suggests summaries or semantic tags.

### 3. Security Enhancements
New authentication APIs with **Entra ID** simplify token management and reduce exposure risks.

### 4. Performance and Lighthouse
SPFx now includes tools to directly test accessibility and performance, in line with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Best practices for SPFx development in 2025

1. **Using Fluent UI v9**: ensures consistency with Teams and M365.  
2. **Optimize bundles**: reduce JS size using lazy loading and dynamic import.  
3. **Accessibility first**: test focus, screen readers, and contrast.  
4. **Integrate Telemetry**: log to understand how web parts are used.  
5. **Automate tests**: unit tests with Jest, integration with Playwright for end-to-end testing.
