# HR 4.0 #1 ‚Äì From CV to Intelligent Onboarding with AI and Microsoft 365

## Introduction

The Human Resources department is often overwhelmed by manual and repetitive tasks: screening resumes, collecting documents for hiring, preparing checklists and onboarding materials. In a competitive environment, where time-to-hire makes a difference, these slow processes can undermine the ability to attract and retain top talent.

With new technologies, however, it is possible to overturn the paradigm. In this first chapter of the *HR 4.0* series, we will see how **AI development** and **Microsoft 365** can be integrated to transform the management of applications and onboarding, making the process fast, standardized, and scalable.

## The Starting Problem

Imagine a medium-sized company that receives **hundreds of applications every month**. HR must:

* manually read each CV,
* extract key skills,
* compare candidates,
* manually prepare onboarding documentation.

The result?

* **Time wasted** on low-value activities,
* **Errors and subjectivity** in selection,
* **Inconsistent onboarding**, with different checklists from manager to manager.

## The solution: AI + Microsoft 365

The key is to combine **artificial intelligence** for CV parsing with the **Microsoft 365** ecosystem, particularly **SharePoint** and **Teams**.

### Step 1 ‚Äì Parsing Resumes with AI

An AI model (e.g., GPT-4.1 or equivalents) analyzes CVs in PDF/Word and extracts structured information:

* technical skills,
* work experience,
* education,
* soft skills.

The result is a **structured JSON** easily integrable into databases or SharePoint lists.

### Step 2 ‚Äì Creating candidate cards in SharePoint

Every CV analyzed becomes a **digital card** in a SharePoint list, with pre-filled fields:

* Name, role, experience,
* Key skills,
* AI match score against the job profile.

### Step 3 ‚Äì Portal Onboarding

Once the candidate is selected, SharePoint also becomes the **onboarding portal**:

* standard documents available in OneDrive,
* activity checklist (e.g., IT accesses, badges, training),
* digital forms for company policies,
* dedicated Teams channel to welcome the new hire.

## Technical Example: AI for CV Parsing

To show the most concrete part, here is an **example in Python** that uses the OpenAI API to transform a PDF CV into a structured JSON:

```python
import openai
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

# Leggi testo da CV PDF
reader = PdfReader("cv_candidato.pdf")
text = "".join([page.extract_text() for page in reader.pages])

# Chiamata API per estrarre dati
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Estrai competenze, esperienze e formazione da un CV. Rispondi in JSON."},
        {"role": "user", "content": text}
    ],
    temperature=0.2
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```



Expected output (simplified example):

```json
{
  "nome": "Mario Rossi",
  "ruolo": "Data Analyst",
  "competenze": ["SQL", "Power BI", "Python"],
  "esperienze": [
    {"azienda": "XYZ Spa", "anni": 3, "ruolo": "Business Analyst"}
  ],
  "formazione": "Laurea in Economia"
}
```



These data can be automatically saved in a **SharePoint list** via Microsoft Graph API or Power Automate.

## Privacy and Security

Managing sensitive personal data such as CVs requires attention:

* AI must be used in **compliance** mode (avoiding sending sensitive data to services that are not GDPR compliant).
* Microsoft 365 ensures secure document management with **access control and encryption**.
* It is advisable to maintain an updated **record of processing activities**.

## Extension: automatic candidate ranking

An additional step can be the **automatic match score**:

* The key requirements of the job profile are defined (e.g., Python, SQL, experience ‚â•3 years).
* AI calculates a score for each CV.
* SharePoint ranks candidates based on the score ‚Üí HR focuses immediately on the top 10%.
