When it comes to **corporate intranet**, SharePoint Online has been the benchmark for years. However, by 2025, it is no longer sufficient to offer a news board or a document repository: companies demand tools that simplify daily work, anticipate user needs, and enhance productivity.  
This is where the combination of **SharePoint Online** with **AI** comes into play.

In this article, we will explore what it means to create a **smart intranet**, which technologies to use, what the concrete benefits are, and how to initiate a sustainable digital transformation journey.

## From Static Intranet to Intelligent Intranet

First-generation intranets were essentially internal websites, featuring company news and file repositories.  
Today we talk about **smart intranets**, characterized by:

- **Semantic search**: users find information with natural language questions.  
- **Dynamic personalization**: content displayed based on role, department, or interests.  
- **Document automation**: processes such as approvals, reviews, and archiving managed automatically.  
- **AI assistance**: integrated chatbots and Copilot that guide the user through business workflows.

## Why SharePoint Online is the Ideal Foundation

SharePoint Online is an integral part of Microsoft 365 and is already connected to Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, and especially to **Microsoft Graph**.  
This makes it the natural starting point for a smart intranet because:

- It is **scalable** and always up to date.  
- It is **secure** and compliant with regulations (GDPR, DORA, NIS2).  
- It has a development ecosystem (SPFx, Power Platform) that allows for targeted customizations.

## AI and Intranet: Concrete Use Cases

### 1. Semantic Search
With the integration of **Microsoft Search + AI**, users can ask:  
> “Show me the updated vacation policy for 2025”  
and get an immediate response, without navigating through folders.

### 2. Business Chatbots
A chatbot integrated into SharePoint can answer HR FAQs, retrieve documents from libraries, open IT tickets, or connect to ERP systems. With a **RAG** approach and governance, it becomes a reliable assistant.

### 3. Copilot for SharePoint
Copilot can generate content for intranet pages, create FAQs from documents, and suggest dynamic links. HR users, for example, can prepare internal communications in just a few minutes.

### 4. Document Automation
Thanks to **Power Automate + AI Builder**, uploaded documents can be automatically analyzed, classified, and sorted. For example: a contract is recognized, validated, and stored in the correct library.

### 5. Intelligent Analytics
With Power BI and Graph Data Connect, managers can gain insights into intranet usage: which content is being searched, which processes take the most time, and where to intervene to improve the user experience.

## Best practices for building a smart intranet

1. **Start with listening**: gather feedback from users to understand real needs.  
2. **Clear governance**: define who manages content, permissions, and automations.  
3. **Accessibility**: comply with WCAG 2.1 AA in every component, to avoid excluding anyone.  
4. **Gradual AI integration**: introduce Copilot and chatbots in small use cases, measure results, scale.  
5. **KPI and measurement**: continuously monitor impact (e.g., average time to find documents).
