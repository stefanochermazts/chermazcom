# HR 4.0 #1 ‚Äì From CV to Intelligent Onboarding with AI and Microsoft 365

## Introduction

The Human Resources department is often overwhelmed by manual and repetitive tasks: screening resumes, collecting hiring documents, preparing checklists and onboarding materials.
In a competitive environment, where the time to hire makes a difference, these slow processes can compromise the ability to attract and retain top talent.

However, with new technologies, it is possible to overturn the paradigm. In this first chapter of the *HR 4.0* series, we will see how **AI development** and **Microsoft 365** can be integrated to transform candidate management and onboarding, making the process fast, standardized, and scalable.

## The Starting Problem

Imagine a medium-sized company that receives **hundreds of applications every month**.
HR must:

* manually read each CV,
* extract key skills,
* compare candidates,
* manually prepare onboarding documentation.

The result?

* **Time wasted** on low-value activities,
* **Errors and subjectivity** in selection,
* **Uneven onboarding**, with different checklists from manager to manager.

---

## The Solution: AI + Microsoft 365

The key is to combine **artificial intelligence** for CV parsing with the **Microsoft 365** ecosystem, particularly **SharePoint** and **Teams**.

### Step 1 ‚Äì CV Parsing with AI

An AI model (for example, GPT-4.1 or equivalents) analyzes CVs in PDF/Word and extracts structured information:

* technical skills,
* work experience,
* education,
* soft skills.

The result is a **structured JSON** that can be easily integrated into databases or SharePoint lists.

### Step 2 ‚Äì Creating Candidate Profiles in SharePoint

Each analyzed CV becomes a **digital profile** in a SharePoint list, with pre-filled fields:

* Name, role, experience,
* Key skills,
* AI match score against the job profile.

### Step 3 ‚Äì Onboarding Portal

Once the candidate is selected, SharePoint also becomes the **onboarding portal**:

* standard documents available in OneDrive,
* activity checklists (e.g., IT access, badge, training),
* digital forms for company policies,
* dedicated Teams channel to welcome the new hire.

## Technical Example: AI for CV Parsing

To show the more concrete part, here‚Äôs an **example in Python** that uses the OpenAI API to transform a CV in PDF into a structured JSON:

```python
import openai
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

# Read text from CV PDF
reader = PdfReader("cv_candidato.pdf")
text = "".join([page.extract_text() for page in reader.pages])

# API call to extract data
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract skills, experiences, and education from a CV. Respond in JSON."},
        {"role": "user", "content": text}
    ],
    temperature=0.2
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```

Expected output (simplified example):

```json
{
  "name": "Mario Rossi",
  "role": "Data Analyst",
  "skills": ["SQL", "Power BI", "Python"],
  "experience": [
    {"company": "XYZ Spa", "years": 3, "role": "Business Analyst"}
  ],
  "education": "Degree in Economics"
}
```

This data can be automatically saved in a **SharePoint list** via Microsoft Graph API or Power Automate.

## Concrete Advantages

The combined approach offers immediate benefits:

### For HR

* Reduction of **70% of the time** spent on screening.
* Ability to focus on interviews and ‚Äúcultural fit.‚Äù

### For Candidates

* Faster responses.
* Clear and standardized onboarding.

### For the Company

* **Scalable** HR processes even during periods of rapid growth.
* Improved **employer branding**: the candidate perceives organization and modernity.

## Privacy and Security

Managing sensitive personal data such as CVs requires attention:

* AI must be used in **compliance** mode (avoiding sending sensitive data to services that are not GDPR compliant).
* Microsoft 365 ensures secure document management with **access control and encryption**.
* It is advisable to maintain an updated **record of processing activities**.

---

## Extension: Automatic Candidate Ranking

An additional step can be the **automatic match score**:

* Key requirements of the job profile are defined (e.g., Python, SQL, experience ‚â•3 years).
* AI calculates a score for each CV.
* SharePoint ranks candidates based on score ‚Üí HR can focus immediately on the top 10%.

## Conclusion

This first chapter of the *HR 4.0* series shows how the union of **AI development** and **Microsoft 365** can radically transform selection and onboarding.
From a slow and manual process ‚Üí to a **fast, standardized, and secure** flow.

In the upcoming articles, we will see how to extend HR digitalization:

* **Automated workflows** for vacations and performance (Article 2),
* **Data security and compliance** in HR in light of DORA/NIS2 (Article 3).
