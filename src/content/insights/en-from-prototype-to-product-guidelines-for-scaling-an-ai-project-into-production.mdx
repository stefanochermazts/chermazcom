In the last two years, many companies have experimented with **Artificial Intelligence** projects. Often, these are **proof-of-concept (PoC)** developed in a few weeks, perhaps with limited datasets and exploratory goals. The problem is that a large portion of these projects never moves beyond the testing phase: they remain interesting experiments but do not become **real and scalable products**.

Bringing an AI project into production requires a shift in mindset: it's not enough to have a model that "works" in the lab; an ecosystem of **processes, tools, and governance** is needed to ensure reliability, security, and sustainability.

It seems that there is no text provided for translation. Please provide the text you would like me to translate to English.

Statistics show that over 70% of AI projects do not make it to production. The main causes are:

- **Absence of metrics**: a prototype may seem effective, but without KPIs, the value cannot be demonstrated.  
- **Non-scalable data**: datasets used for PoCs do not reflect the complexity of the real world.  
- **Missing infrastructure**: models trained on laptops are not ready for enterprise environments.  
- **Weak governance**: there are no security, compliance, and audit policies in place.  
- **Unrealistic expectations**: management often expects miracles, without considering costs and limitations.

## The path from PoC to product

Scaling an AI project means following some fundamental phases:

### 1. Definition of Requirements
- Identify the **concrete use cases** and the involved stakeholders.  
- Establish measurable KPIs: accuracy, response times, inference costs.  
- Evaluate regulatory constraints (GDPR, DORA, NIS2, sector-specific).

### 2. Data Preparation
- Create pipelines for **data collection, cleaning, and labeling**.  
- Define quality policies and continuous updating.  
- Consider **data governance** tools and centralized catalogs.

### 3. Choice of Architecture
- Evaluate pre-trained models vs fine-tuning.  
- Decide between **external APIs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and **self-hosted models** (Llama, Mistral).  
- Define scalability: serverless, Kubernetes, GPU on-demand.

### 4. MLOps Implementation
The heart of scalability is **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**:
- Versioning of data and models.  
- CI/CD pipelines for training and deployment.  
- Continuous monitoring of performance and drift.  
- Automation of rollbacks in case of regression.

### 5. Security and Compliance
- Anonymization and pseudonymization of data.  
- Granular access controls and request logs.  
- Complete audit trail for internal and external inspections.  
- Policies for the ethical use of AI (no sensitive data in prompts, explainability).

### 6. Deployment and Monitoring
- Define **clear SLAs**: response times, uptime, costs.  
- Use observability tools: tracing, logging, alerts.  
- Implement **A/B testing** systems to compare model versions.
