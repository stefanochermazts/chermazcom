# HR 4.0 #3 â€“ HR Security and Compliance with AI and Microsoft 365

## Introduction

HR data is among the most sensitive in a company: salaries, medical certificates, disciplinary notes. Protecting this information is crucial not only for employee trust but also for compliance with **NIS2** and **DORA** regulations.

---

## The Initial Problem

* HR files shared via email without controls.
* No traceability in case of data breaches.
* Lack of compliant incident response procedures.

Consequences: risk of penalties, loss of trust, reputational damage.

---

## The Solution: AI + Microsoft 365

### Document Classification with AI

* AI model analyzes HR documents and classifies them (e.g., salaries, resumes, medical certificates).
* Output: metadata that enables dedicated policies.

### Security Policies with Microsoft 365

* **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: blocking external sharing of classified documents.
* **Automatic Tagging**: confidentiality labels based on AI classification.
* **Audit Trail**: every access and sharing tracked.

### Automated Incident Response

* Incident log on SharePoint.
* Power Automate sends automatic alerts to IT Security and the DPO.
* Notification within 24 hours as required by NIS2/DORA.

## Technical Example: AI Prompt for Classification

Example of a prompt to classify HR documents:

```text
You are an AI assistant for data security. Analyze the provided document and respond in JSON indicating:
- category: [resume | salaries | medical_certificates | others]
- sensitivity_level: [low | medium | high]
```

---

## Concrete Benefits

* **For HR**: reduction of risks related to improper data management.
* **For the company**: regulatory compliance and audit trail ready in case of inspection.
* **For employees**: greater trust in the protection of their personal data.

---

## Conclusion

With AI and Microsoft 365, HR security moves from manual activity to an **intelligent, automated, and compliant** process.

The *HR 4.0* series has shown how to transform the HR department:

1. Selection and onboarding with AI (Article 1).
