### The Origins of Sudoku: A Journey into the Past

Contrary to what many believe, Sudoku did not originate in Japan. Its origins date back to the 18th century, when the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler devised the "Latin square," in which numbers or symbols do not repeat in rows and columns.



However, modern Sudoku took shape much later. In the 1970s, American Howard Garns, an architect passionate about puzzles, first published a game called "Number Place" in the magazine "Dell Pencil Puzzles & Word Games". This game was then introduced to Japan in the 1980s by the publisher "Nikoli", which gave it the name we know today: “Sudoku”, an abbreviation of “Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru”, which means “the numbers must be used only once”.









### The Global Rise of Sudoku

Sudoku experienced explosive growth starting in the 2000s, when Wayne Gould developed a program to generate puzzles and distributed them to British newspapers. The game quickly became a global phenomenon.



Since then, Sudoku has started to appear everywhere: books, applications, websites, and even international tournaments. Today, it is possible to tackle puzzles of every level of difficulty, from those for beginners to extremely complex ones, such as the infamous “Al Escargot,” considered one of the most difficult puzzles ever created.
