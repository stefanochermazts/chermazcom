# Copilot for Microsoft 365: what it can really do for businesses and developers

In 2023, Microsoft announced **Copilot for Microsoft 365**, an artificial intelligence-based assistant that promises to transform the way millions of users work every day with Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Teams, and SharePoint.  
Today, in 2025, Copilot is no longer an experiment: it is an integral part of the Microsoft 365 suite and is changing habits, processes, and even the skills required of developers.

In this article, we will see **what Copilot can do**, how it works, what the benefits are for users and companies, and what new opportunities arise for developers and IT teams who want to integrate it into their workflows.

## What is Copilot for Microsoft 365

Copilot is a **natively integrated AI assistant** within Microsoft 365 apps. It is not an external plugin: it leverages Microsoft's cloud infrastructure, the **GPT-4o** model (and later), and the business data available through **Microsoft Graph**.

### Key Features
- **Conversational**: you can ask in natural language to create documents, summarize emails, or generate reports.  
- **Contextual**: accesses your business data (with permissions respected) to generate relevant output.  
- **Multi-app**: works in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint.  
- **Extensible**: developers can create custom plugins and integrations.

## Benefits for Business Users

### 1. Automation of Daily Tasks
- **Word**: draft generation, summaries, translations.  
- **Excel**: formulas, pivots, and charts created from prompts.  
- **Outlook**: email summaries, response suggestions.  
- **PowerPoint**: complete presentations based on a text document.

### 2. Better Time Management
Copilot filters relevant information, reducing the time spent reading emails or searching for documents. In Teams, for example, it can **summarize recorded meetings** and generate automatic to-do lists.

### 3. Accessibility and Democratization
Less experienced users can achieve complex results (charts, macros, reports) without knowing advanced languages or formulas.

## Opportunities for Developers

Copilot is not just a tool for business users: it is also a platform on which developers can build.

### 1. Extensions via Microsoft Graph
Developers can connect Copilot to custom business data by leveraging the Graph APIs.  
Example: a plugin that allows Copilot to query the customer database or the ERP system.

### 2. Custom plugins and connectors
With the **Copilot Studio** framework, it is possible to create **custom connectors** that expand Copilot's capabilities by integrating it with internal or third-party systems.

### 3. Development in SharePoint Framework (SPFx)
Copilot also integrates into SharePoint Online: SPFx developers can create web parts and extensions that interact with the assistant, enriching the intranet experience.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Security and Governance
Copilot accesses business data through Microsoft Graph. Without proper permission configuration, it risks **exposing sensitive information**. It is therefore crucial to define:
- Role-based access policies.  
- Query monitoring.  
- Compliance controls (GDPR, DORA, NIS2).

### User Training
Many users tend to use Copilot as a "toy" or in a superficial manner. Targeted **training** is needed to make the most of it, with practical examples and effective prompts.

### Cost
Copilot has an additional cost (license per user/month). It is important to evaluate its ROI by comparing the price with the benefits in terms of productivity.
