# HR 4.0 #2 â€“ Automation of HR Processes with Power Automate and OneDrive

## Introduction

Managing leave and performance via email or Excel sheets only leads to chaos and wasted time. With **Power Automate** and **OneDrive**, it is possible to digitize HR processes by creating simple, transparent, and secure flows.

---

## The Initial Problem

* Employees send leave requests via email â†’ no traceability.
* Managers must manually check availability and overlaps.
* Annual evaluations are scattered across unversioned documents and without centralized approvals.

Consequences: frequent errors, employee dissatisfaction, wasted time for HR.

---

## The Solution: Microsoft 365 as an HR Platform

### Leave Workflow with Power Automate

1. Employee fills out a form (Microsoft Forms or SharePoint List).
2. Power Automate flow sends request to the manager on Teams/Outlook.
3. Manager approves/rejects â†’ automatic status update in SharePoint.
4. HR receives notification and complete log.

### Performance Evaluations with OneDrive and SharePoint

* Evaluation templates stored in OneDrive.
* Automatic versioning â†’ no document conflicts.
* Controlled access and recorded approvals.
* Consolidated results in SharePoint for reporting.

## Technical Example: JSON Power Automate

Example of steps for managing leave:

```json
{
  "trigger": "On new item in SharePoint list",
  "actions": [
    { "sendApproval": "ManagerEmail" },
    { "updateItem": { "Status": "Approved/Rejected" } },
    { "sendNotification": "HRTeam" }
  ]
}
```

This simplified schema shows the basic logic of a flow that connects employees, managers, and HR.

---

## Concrete Benefits

* **For HR**: less manual work, more control.
* **For employees**: greater transparency and immediate feedback.
* **For managers**: quick decisions and complete traceability.

---

## Privacy and Security

* All data managed in Microsoft 365 â†’ compliance with company policies and GDPR.
* Controlled access with granular permissions.
* Audit trail available for every approval.

---

## Conclusion

With Power Automate and OneDrive, the HR department becomes more agile and efficient.
Leave management and performance evaluations transition from a manual and chaotic process to a **digitized, traceable, and secure** flow.

In the next article, we will see how to extend HR digitization to **data protection and regulatory compliance** (DORA/NIS2).
