# NIS2 and DORA in practice: how to use Microsoft 365 to manage incident logs and IT compliance

## Introduction

The **NIS2** and **DORA** directives impose new stringent rules for managing cybersecurity and operational resilience. For banking, insurance companies, and IT providers, it's not just about complying with regulations: a structured approach is needed to ensure continuity and governance. In this guide, we will explore how to implement **NIS2 compliance Microsoft 365** and **DORA compliance Microsoft 365**, leveraging tools like SharePoint, Power Automate, and Teams for **security governance**.

## 1. The Problem

One of the main obstacles that companies face when dealing with **NIS2 compliance Microsoft 365** and **DORA compliance Microsoft 365** is the fragmented management of IT incidents. In many organizations, incidents are still recorded through simple emails or separate ticketing systems. This approach not only makes it difficult to have a comprehensive view but also prevents ensuring an audit trail compliant with the requirements of **NIS2 DORA IT security**.

Another widespread issue is the lack of a centralized **SharePoint incident log**. Without a unique and structured database, it becomes complex to track events, correlate causes, and demonstrate to regulatory authorities the actual compliance with regulatory requirements.

The slowness in notifications represents an additional risk. In various business contexts, the DPO and the IT Security department are informed late or with incomplete information, compromising the ability to respond in a timely manner. It is important to remember that NIS2 and DORA require a **incident response 24h Microsoft 365**: the notification must be prompt, documented, and verifiable.

Finally, the lack of coordination leads to indirect violations of regulations. Non-standardized processes expose the organization to penalties and undermine internal and external trust. It is in this scenario that tools like SharePoint, Power Automate, and Teams can become the heart of a **Microsoft 365 security governance** strategy.

## 2. The solution with Microsoft 365

The most effective response to the challenges of NIS2 and DORA compliance is to leverage tools that many companies already possess, namely Microsoft 365. The platform, when configured correctly, allows for the construction of a true ecosystem of **Microsoft 365 security governance**, capable of covering the needs for logging, automation, collaboration, and classification.

The first step is the creation of a **SharePoint incident log**. Instead of relying on Excel sheets or scattered notes, a structured list allows for the recording of each event with key fields such as date, category, severity, and corrective actions. By enabling versioning and granular permissions, the organization gains not only complete traceability but also the ability to demonstrate to authorities a ready and verifiable **DORA SharePoint incident log example**.

This is complemented by the power of **Power Automate incident response**. Through automated flows, every new incident recorded can generate a trigger that sends immediate notifications to IT Security, DPO, and the legal team. If no one takes charge of the case within the expected hours, an automatic reminder ensures that the event does not remain pending. This approach reduces the risk of delays and allows for compliance with notification requirements within 24 hours, as mandated by European directives. In technical literature, we often refer to *Power Automate flows for NIS2 compliance*, precisely because this tool becomes central in the response chain.

Collaboration is enhanced through Microsoft Teams. Instead of multiplying chats and emails, a dedicated channel for incident response allows for real-time discussions, attaching logs and documents, and maintaining a history of decisions. The integration with SharePoint ensures that every update in **SharePoint incident management** is immediately visible in the Teams channel, improving operational cohesion.

Finally, the use of artificial intelligence allows for a qualitative leap. Tools like **Azure OpenAI security classification** enable the analysis of incident content and automatically categorize them (e.g., phishing, data leak, infrastructure). This **AI incident classification** not only accelerates the work of analysts but also provides suggestions on corrective actions to take. It is a concrete example of how *AI development* is applied to security and compliance, reducing human errors and standardizing procedures.

## 3. Benefits

The advantages of a Microsoft 365-based approach to NIS2 and DORA compliance are manifold and touch upon both the technical and organizational dimensions. First and foremost, the primary benefit is **regulatory compliance**. Having a centralized registry in SharePoint, automated workflows in Power Automate, and integrated traceability allows the company to demonstrate to supervisory authorities that it is ready to comply with European directives without having to invest in often complex and costly external platforms.

A second crucial aspect is **speed**. Thanks to **Power Automate incident response**, every new event is immediately notified to the responsible parties. This allows for compliance with the 24-hour notification requirement set by regulations, drastically reducing downtime and increasing the organization's response capacity.

There is also a theme of **operational efficiency**. The coordinated use of SharePoint and Teams eliminates the fragmentation typical of management through email or unstructured chat. A dedicated channel in Teams, integrated with the SharePoint log, ensures that all involved parties have access to the same information and can collaborate without wasting time. This translates into more streamlined processes and less margin for error.

Finally, the aspect of **trust** should not be underestimated. Having a complete and easily accessible audit trail increases internal transparency and credibility with partners and authorities. **Microsoft 365 security governance** thus becomes not only a technical tool but also an element of reputation and reliability for the entire company.

## 4. Future Extensions

The Microsoft 365-based approach can be further extended to strengthen resilience and improve incident response capabilities. One initial area of development is the integration with corporate SIEM systems. By connecting security logs to a centralized incident register, the organization can correlate events in real-time and anticipate threats, transforming simple tracking into a true predictive tool.

A second step involves the use of **Power BI dashboards** to analyze incident trends. The data collected in SharePoint and enriched by Power Automate flows can be visually represented to identify recurring patterns, more exposed areas, and performance KPIs related to **NIS2 DORA IT security**. This enables management to make evidence-based decisions rather than relying on perceptions.

Finally, automation can extend to escalation to external vendors. In complex scenarios, where the incident involves third-party services, **Power Automate incident response** flows can trigger notifications and standard procedures even outside corporate boundaries, ensuring continuity and compliance. Looking ahead, the use of artificial intelligence, for example with **AI for IT security incident classification** models, could be directly integrated into monitoring pipelines, making classification and response even more immediate.

## Conclusion

Addressing compliance with NIS2 and DORA does not mean having to radically rethink the entire IT infrastructure, but rather strategically leveraging existing tools such as SharePoint, Power Automate, and Teams. These components, when orchestrated correctly, enable the construction of a **Microsoft 365 security governance** framework capable of centralizing logs, ensuring timely notifications, and providing a solid audit trail for inspections and audits.

The most relevant aspect is not only technical but also consultative: each company must adapt the proposed model to its own context, internal policies, and industry needs. The added value lies in transforming Microsoft 365 from a simple collaborative suite into a platform for compliance and operational resilience, reducing the risk of penalties and improving the trust of partners and customers.

In the future, integration with SIEM, visualization with Power BI, and the use of **AI incident classification** will make processes even smarter and more predictive. This is therefore not a static solution, but an evolutionary path that grows alongside regulatory and business needs.
