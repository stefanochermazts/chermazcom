# How to Structure a Project to Make the Most of AI Development Tools

**for those looking for "AI-development"**: AI only makes productive projects **organized, documented, tested, and governed**. The following are needed: clear objectives, modular repo, domain glossary, test scaffolding, standard prompts, semantic commits, CI with minimum quality, secret management, ADR for architectural decisions, and a maintenance policy.

In this guide, we will go **in depth** into each phase, with **objectives, expected outputs, common errors, and metrics** to measure whether your *sviluppo‑AI* is really working.

It seems that the text you wanted to translate is missing. Please provide the text you would like me to translate, and I'll be happy to assist you!

## 1) Clear definition of the objective (foundation of the context)

**Objective**: provide the AI with a comprehensible *brief* that reduces ambiguity.

**What to do**

* Write 5–10 **user stories** prioritized (format: *As a \[role] I want \[action] for \[value]*).
* Map 3–5 **non-functional constraints**: performance, target browsers, cloud budget, compliance (GDPR/DORA).
* List the expected **interfaces** (external APIs, DB, identity).

**Expected Output**

* `/docs/vision.md` with purpose, KPIs, and non-negotiable choices.

**Common Errors**

* Backlog "weekly spending": heterogeneous and inconsistent → *AI-development* confused.

**Metrics**

* % stories with acceptance criteria (target ≥ 80%).

## 2) Choice and Explanation of the Stack (Reducing the Surface of Error)

**Objective**: an explicit *golden path*, so Cursor/Copilot do not suggest contradictory patterns.

**What to do**

* Choose **one** stack per layer (e.g. *Astro+React* for web, *Node/Express* for API, *Postgres* for DB).
* Document versions and libraries in the `README.md` (e.g. Node 20, pnpm, Tailwind 3).
* Preconfigure **lint/format** (ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint) and **rules**.

**Expected Output**

* `README.md` → sections *Stack*, *Scripts*, *Conventions*.
* `.nvmrc`, `.editorconfig`, `eslint.config.*`.

**Common Errors**

* Mix of frameworks without motivation; duplicate dependencies.

**Metrics**

* Lint pass rate in CI (target 100%).

## 3) Structuring the repository (navigability for AI)

**Objective**: make the code **predictable**. The *AI-development* tools reason by patterns and proximity.

**What to do**

```
/src
  /components      # UI o unità riusabili
  /pages           # routing
  /services        # integrazioni esterne
  /domain          # modelli e logica dominio
/tests             # unit/integration/e2e
/docs              # specifiche e decisioni
/scripts           # utility di build/dev
```



* Add `.env.example` and `ENVIRONMENT.md` (secret policy).
* Use **path aliases** (e.g. `@/services`) to reduce fragile imports.

**Expected Output**

* Folder map in the `README.md`.

**Common Errors**

* File "God object", cross-import circulars, `utils.js` omnivorous.

**Metrics**

* Average complexity per file (e.g. < 15), coupling between modules decreasing.

## 4) Domain Documentation (Semantic Grounding)

**Objective**: provide **language and rules** of the business that the AI must adhere to.

**What to do**

* `/docs/glossario.md`: key terms, synonyms, examples.
* `/docs/regole-dominio.md`: constraints (e.g. vacation > 26 days → HR approval).
* ADR (*Architecture Decision Records*) for relevant choices: `/docs/adr/0001-tall-vs-astro.md`.

**Expected Output**

* Glossary linked from comments and prompts.

**Common Errors**

* Inconsistent terminology across modules → divergent AI responses.

**Metrics**

* Domain/week clarification issues (trend → 0).

## 5) Testing and Use Cases (learning through examples)

**Objective**: provide Cursor/Copilot with **verifiable patterns**.

**What to do**

* Set up *scaffold* tests (unit/integration). Even empty but **named**.
* Write **spec in plain text** next to the code (e.g. `service.spec.md`).
* Cover "critical" functions with docstring tests (input→expected) that the AI can read.

**Expected Output**

* `tests/**` divided by layer; report coverage in CI.

**Common Errors**

* Reactive tests (written *after* the bugs); giant fixtures not reusable.

**Metrics**

* Coverage lines/branch (initial target 60% → 80%); average time to green PR.

## 6) Internal prompt engineering (reusable instructions)

**Objective**: standardize how you ask for help from AI for *sviluppo‑AI*.

**What to do**

* Folder `/prompts/` with templates: `refactor.prompt.md`, `testgen.prompt.md`, `review.prompt.md`.
* T‑C‑G‑O structure: **Task**, **Constraints**, **Grounding** (link file/glossary), **Output** (desired schema).
* Create a “**comment policy**” (e.g., docstring with usage examples) to enhance local context.

**Expected Output**

* Reusable prompts linked in the PR.

**Common Errors**

* Vague requests (“improve the code”); non-deterministic output.

**Metrics**

* % of AI requests requiring adjustments > 2 (decreasing trend).

## 7) Semantic commits and changelog (traces for AI)

**Objective**: transform the repo history into **signals** that AI can use.

**What to do**

* Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:` …).
* Hook that updates `CHANGELOG.md` (also with AI) and stages it.
* PR template with *context, alternative solutions discarded, risks*.

**Expected output**

* Consistent and **readable** changelog for both AI and humans.

**Common Errors**

* "update" messages; PR without description.

**Metrics**

* Average code review time; % PR with complete description (target ≥ 90%).

## 8) Integrate AI into the development cycle (controlled collaboration)

**Objective**: use AI as a *co-developer* while maintaining **human control**.

**What to do**

* Ask for **explanations** about the generated code before accepting it.
* Use **feature flags** to release safely.
* Limit AI changes to **small scopes** (one function, one file, one test at a time).

**Expected Output**

* PR small, motivated, reversible.

**Common Errors**

* "Big bang refactor" generated by AI; lock-in on opaque decisions.

**Metrics**

* Revert rate < 5%; post-merge/weekly defects decreasing.

## 9) CI/CD, security and quality (minimum guarantees)

**Objective**: prevent *AI development* from introducing regressions or risks.

**What to do**

* Pipeline with: lint + test + build + **type‑check** + **security scan** (e.g. `npm audit`, `trivy` for container).
* **Secrets**: `.env` only local; in CI use secrets manager (Netlify env, GitHub Actions secrets).
* **SAST/DAST** basic; dependency policy (renovate dependabot).

**Expected Output**

* `DEPLOY.md` with environments, commands, rollback; CI badge on the README.

**Common Errors**

* Committed secrets; absence of security checks.

**Metrics**

* Build pass rate (target ≥ 95%); critical vulnerabilities = 0; average deployment time.

## 10) Maintenance, governance, and growth (a project that ages well)

**Objective**: to ensure that the project remains **AI‑friendly** over time.

**What to do**

* **ADR** for every important architectural decision; review quarterly.
* **Roadmap** in `/docs/roadmap.md` with milestones and deprecations.
* **Refactor budget**: 10–15% of sprint time for ongoing cleanup.

**Expected Output**

* Consistent repo, technical debt under control, *AI-development* always effective.

**Common Errors**

* Chaotic growth, outdated dependencies, obsolete documents.

**Metrics**

* Technical debt issues closed/sprint; dependencies *outdated* < 10%.

## SEO for "AI development": where and how to use the keyword

* Insert **sviluppo‑AI** in: title H1/H2, `description`, `excerpt`, first paragraph, 2–3 section headings.
* Use natural variants: *sviluppo AI*, *strumenti AI per sviluppatori*, *AI nel ciclo di sviluppo*.
* Internally link to: *RAG per codice*, *AI per changelog/README*, *Agentic AI in CI/CD*.
* Add **FAQ** at the bottom with schema markup (e.g. *Cos’è lo sviluppo‑AI?*, *Come preparare il repo per Cursor?*).
