2025 is a watershed year for **compliance in the technology sector**: two European regulations, **DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)** and **NIS2 (Network and Information Security Directive)**, come fully into force and reshape the rules of the game for IT companies, digital service providers, and organizations operating in critical sectors.

Many businesses today find themselves asking: *What does it actually mean to comply with DORA and NIS2? What obligations do they entail? What risks are incurred in case of non-compliance?*  
In this article, we will answer these questions, providing a clear overview and practical advice for those facing this challenge.

## DORA and NIS2: a brief summary

- **DORA** (EU Regulation 2022/2554) is specifically designed for the **financial** sector and all its IT suppliers. The goal is to ensure that banks, insurance companies, fintechs, and technology partners can withstand cyber incidents and operate continuously.  
- **NIS2** (EU Directive 2022/2555) has a broader scope: it aims to raise the level of **cybersecurity** across all critical sectors (energy, transport, healthcare, digital infrastructure, public administration) and imposes obligations on digital service providers as well.

Together, these regulations create a much stricter framework for cybersecurity and operational resilience.

## Who is Involved

### DORA
- Financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, investment firms).  
- Critical IT providers for the financial sector (cloud providers, software houses, outsourcers).

### NIS2
- Operators of essential services (hospitals, utilities, telecommunications).  
- Providers of digital infrastructure (data centers, DNS, cloud services).  
- Medium and large enterprises that manage critical data or sensitive services.

üëâ In practice, almost all IT companies that provide services to large enterprises or public entities are affected by at least one of the two regulations.

## The main obligations

### 1. Governance and Responsibilities
Management (board, C-level) becomes **directly responsible** for compliance. It is not enough to delegate to IT: decisions must be deliberate, documented, and approved at the management level.

### 2. Risk management
- Continuous identification and assessment of ICT risks.  
- Adoption of proportionate technical and organizational controls.  
- Periodic update of the **risk register**.

### 3. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
- Mandatory **BCDR** plan.  
- Documented periodic tests (at least annually).  
- Recovery procedures with measurable RTO/RPO.

### 4. Incident reporting
- Obligation to report relevant incidents within **24 hours**.  
- Final report with impact analysis and corrective measures.

### 5. Supply chain and suppliers
- Contracts with suppliers must include specific clauses on security and audit.  
- Continuous monitoring of the critical supply chain.

### 6. Training
- Periodic training for employees and management.  
- Awareness tests (phishing simulation, tabletop exercise).

## Risks of Non-Compliance

The penalties are significant:
- **NIS2**: up to **10 million euros or 2% of global revenue**.  
- **DORA**: variable fines but proportional to the severity of the incident and the size of the entity.

In addition to fines, the greatest risk is **loss of reputation** and the possible exclusion from public/financial tenders or contracts.

- **SIEM and SOC** tools to detect incidents in real time.

### Step 4 ‚Äì Testing and Simulations
- Tabletop exercise with management.  
- Simulations of cyber attacks.  
- Documented business continuity tests.

### Step 5 ‚Äì Continuous Monitoring

## Case study: an IT provider for the banking sector

A software company that provides solutions to Italian banks has addressed the DORA/NIS2 compliance through this process:

1. **Assessment**: identified 25 compliance gaps.  
2. **Remediation**: updated policies, introduced a centralized logging system, defined BCDR plan.  
3. **Training**: workshop for the board and operational training for the IT team.  
4. **Testing**: simulation of a ransomware attack with measured response times.

Results:  
- **Incident response time reduced by 45%**.  
- Passed external audit without any major non-conformities.  
- Increased trust from banking clients, who now include the company among "trusted" suppliers.

## Conclusion

DORA and NIS2 are not merely "regulatory compliance," but tools that encourage companies to **structure more robust and resilient processes**.  
For IT providers, they represent both a challenge and an opportunity: those who adapt in a timely manner gain competitive advantage, credibility, and trust.

In 2025, a new standard is set: it is no longer enough to protect systems; it is necessary to demonstrate the ability to withstand, recover, and document every action.
