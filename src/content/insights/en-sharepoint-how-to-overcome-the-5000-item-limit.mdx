# **Overcoming the SharePoint Limit**

## **Overcoming the item limit in SharePoint lists**

In the vast arena of data management, SharePoint stands out as an efficient and versatile solution. However, this does not exclude the presence of challenges. One of the most common issues concerns the **5000 item limit** in SharePoint lists. This article delves deeply into the problem and provides effective solutions to overcome it, enhancing your data management and, consequently, your productivity.



## **Understanding the Issue: the Limit in SharePoint Lists**

To understand how to manage the limit, it is important to comprehend what it represents and how it influences the user experience. SharePoint lists have a list view threshold of 5000 items. Beyond the threshold, certain operations may slow down or be blocked.



### **Why does the limit exist?**

The limit exists to ensure optimal platform performance and protect the farm from costly queries.



## **Practical Solutions**

Although the limit presents a challenge, there are several solutions that can be adopted to overcome it. Below, we list a few:





- **Column indexing**: speeds up queries and filters.
- **Filters and sorting**: reduce the items displayed in views.
- **Targeted views**: define views with criteria that remain below threshold.
- **Folders and segmentation**: divide large datasets into logical containers.

## **Conclusion**

Managing the **list view threshold of 5000 items** in SharePoint is possible and leads to greater efficiency and productivity. The goal is not to bypass the threshold, but to work strategically within the constraints.
