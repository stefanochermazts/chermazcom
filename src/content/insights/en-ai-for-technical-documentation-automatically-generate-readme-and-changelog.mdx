# AI for Technical Documentation: Automatically Generate README and Changelog

## Introduction

One of the most common problems in software projects is **outdated or missing documentation**. Unupdated READMEs, handwritten changelogs with months of delays, and repositories lacking release notes create confusion for both internal teams and clients. Over time, this degrades the overall quality of the software and slows down the onboarding of new developers.

Here’s why today we talk about **AI technical documentation**, an integral part of [sviluppo-AI](/sviluppo-ai): AI-based tools that support developers in the automatic creation and maintenance of files like `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. In this article, we will see how to use an **AI readme generator** and an **AI changelog generator** to automate repetitive tasks, integrating these processes directly into DevOps workflows.

## Why AI is Useful in Technical Documentation

Writing code and writing documentation are two very different skills. Many developers prefer to focus on software logic, leaving behind README files, manuals, and changelogs. This is where AI comes into play: with natural language processing, models like **OpenAI GPT-4.1** or **Claude Sonnet 4** can read a commit, analyze a code diff, and produce coherent and readable text.

The main advantages of **AI technical documentation** are:

* **Automation**: no more manual notes at the end of the sprint, documentation is generated in real time.
* **Consistency**: a uniform style across all README files and changelogs.
* **Speed**: drastic reduction in the time spent by developers on repetitive writing.
* **DevOps Alignment**: documentation becomes an integral part of the CI/CD pipeline.

For a comprehensive overview of other use cases, you can refer to our [AI development guide](/sviluppo-ai).

## Automatically Generate README

An **AI readme generator** can analyze the structure of the repository and produce a `README.md` file complete with:

* Project description.
* System requirements.
* Installation instructions.
* Usage examples.
* License and references.

### Practical Example with OpenAI API

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

repo_summary = "Questo progetto implementa un microservizio in Python per la gestione di richieste API."

prompt = f"Genera un file README.md per il seguente progetto: {repo_summary}"

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```



This simple script acts as an **ai readme generator**, producing a ready-to-use file. The result can be saved directly in the repository.

### Best practice

* Customize the prompt with context (dependencies, frameworks, languages).
* Integrate the script into **Git hooks** to generate updated README files when the project structure changes.
* Manually verify critical sections (license, configuration).

## Generate automatic CHANGELOG

The changelog is essential for understanding how the software evolves. With an **AI changelog generator**, it is possible to analyze commit messages and create a `CHANGELOG.md` file organized by version.

### Example with Python + Git hooks

```python
import subprocess
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Recupera gli ultimi commit
git_log = subprocess.check_output(["git", "log", "--oneline", "-n", "10"]).decode("utf-8")

prompt = f"Genera un changelog in formato Markdown dai seguenti commit:\n{git_log}"

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

with open("CHANGELOG.md", "a") as f:
    f.write(response.choices[0].message.content)
```



The script can be automatically invoked via a **post-commit Git hook**, updating the changelog with every change.

### Best practice

* Use conventions in commit messages (e.g. *Conventional Commits*) to improve the quality of the changelog.
* Maintain a manual backup for critical versions.
* Integrate the changelog with automated release tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD).

## Integration into the DevOps Flow

The **AI technical documentation** becomes even more powerful when integrated into a CI/CD flow. For example:

* **Pipeline GitHub Actions** that generates and validates the README on every pull request.
* **Script in GitLab CI/CD** that updates the changelog at the time of deployment.
* **Workflow with Power Automate** or Jenkins to notify via Teams/Slack the updated files.

In this way, documentation is no longer a manual task but part of the software lifecycle, reducing the risks of inconsistencies.

## Benefits and Limitations of AI in Documentation

The benefits are significant: increased productivity, reduction of technical debt, and improved onboarding of new developers. However, there are also limitations:

* **Variable quality**: AI can generate texts that are too generic or imprecise.
* **Human oversight required**: a human reviewer is still necessary.
* **Context dependency**: without clear commits and well-structured repos, results decline.

The key is to consider AI as a **documentation assistant**, not as the sole author.
