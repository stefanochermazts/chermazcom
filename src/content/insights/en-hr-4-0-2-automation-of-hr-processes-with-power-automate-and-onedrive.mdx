# HR 4.0 #2 â€“ Automation of HR processes with Power Automate and OneDrive

## The solution: Microsoft 365 as an HR platform

### Workflow holidays with Power Automate

1. Employee fills out a form (Microsoft Forms or SharePoint List).
2. Power Automate flow sends a request to the manager on Teams/Outlook.
3. Manager approves/rejects â†’ automatic status update in SharePoint.
4. HR receives notification and complete log.

### Performance Evaluations with OneDrive and SharePoint

* Evaluation models stored in OneDrive.
* Automatic versioning â†’ no document conflicts.
* Controlled access and recorded approvals.
* Consolidated results in SharePoint for reporting.

    { "sendNotification": "HRTeam" }
  ]
}
